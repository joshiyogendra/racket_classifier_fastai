# Racket Classifier
Classifier created as part of fastai ai tutorial exercise to identify Tennis, Badminton and Table Tennis rackets
This implements the learning from Lesson 1 (and Lesson 3) of fast.ai deep learning turorials by Jeremy Howard (https://github.com/jph00)

Happy tht I was able to achieve over 95% accuracy using 1000 images spread across the three categories

This is my first github entry.

Hope this is useful to a few people and also I am looking forward to the experts to help me make the code better
